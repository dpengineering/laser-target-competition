# Hi there! So you've been assigned this project...

Or you chose it, but let's face it, no ones doing that. Anyway, here are somethings you might want to know. 

## This project...

### isn't finished
Neither the physical project or the programming side is done. The programming side is basically a virtual mock up of what the physical project does, but your cursor(or finger?) is the laser. It was made because at the time of start, the project was a CAD model. I'll get into what **I want** for this project later, **which may be very different from your vision**. Keep that in mind. I don't have control over what you do, but I have some ideas and I think they're good. Pretty please do them?
### is using Kivy
Not the fancy new thing that works way better. Pyside6, built by Aayush. Thanks Aayush.üêê
